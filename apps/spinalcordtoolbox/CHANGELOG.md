# spinalcordtoolbox

## 0.7.20261007

### Minor Changes

- SpinalCordToolbox now uses the FreeBrowse viewer (NiiVue 1.0) that TopoFit uses, through one shared mount helper in `@neurodesk/runtime-support/freebrowse-viewer`. Zoom and pan work in 2D and 3D with the wheel, right-drag and two-finger pinch, and a reset restores the view. FreeBrowse supplies layout, intensity window, opacity, colormap and image download, so SCT's duplicate toolbar controls are gone; the viewer is served from the app, not a CDN.

  The log below the viewer can be enlarged by dragging its top edge or from the keyboard, and keeps an Analysis log (tasks, parameters, result summaries, warnings) apart from the Technical log. The shared `nd-console` gained `resizable` and `channels`.

  Compare shows up to four loaded images side by side with linked layout, zoom, pan and crosshair (matched in scanner millimetres), which can be unlinked for unregistered follow-up scans. Each image keeps its own results, edits and analysis inputs when you switch between them.

  The shared mask editor now edits results on the FreeBrowse viewer; edited files are named `_edited` and the approximate browser lesion metrics are withdrawn when a mask they used is edited. The vertebral-labeling port and its PAM50 templates are removed; TotalSpineSeg provides disc labels. The SCT app is prepared for the MS lesion model (`lesion_ms`), which stays unavailable until the converted model is hosted.

## 0.6.20261007

### Patch Changes

- 70f2770: Space the technical log's Copy and Clear buttons apart by grouping them in the shared `nd-console-actions` row; they had run together as "CopyClear". Remove the unused legacy `.console-clear` styles.

## 0.6.20261004

### Minor Changes

- Add SCT cord morphometry and standalone lesion analysis for uploaded, generated or manually edited masks, without an anatomy image. Analysis runs in the browser by default, executing the pinned, unchanged SCT 7.3 Python in a Pyodide worker, or optionally on a paired Neurodesk compute server in the pinned SCT Docker image. Both keep SCT's CSV, XLSX, pickle and labeled NIfTI outputs and show where results were computed, because WebAssembly floating-point results can differ from native SCT. Server jobs can be recovered, cancelled and deleted; browser runs cancel by terminating their worker. Automatic browser lesion metrics stay labelled approximate. Shared compute connections support selected tools and explicit HTTPS reverse-proxy addresses.

### Patch Changes

- a866951: Remove the obsolete vertebral labeling controls. TotalSpineSeg remains available for disc labeling.

## 0.5.20261004

### Patch Changes

- a928230: Correct segmentation and label results by hand before downloading them. Every mask and label-map row in Results (cord, lesion, TotalSpineSeg labels and disc markers) now has an Edit button that opens the shared mask editor under the viewer toolbar, with the input image as the base. Apply replaces the result with the edited uint8 NIfTI under the same file name and labels the row `(edited)`; Download then returns the edit. Cancel, a new run, Clear results, a new input or hiding the edited overlay discard unapplied strokes. Lesion statistics and automation reports keep the values the pipeline computed.

### Patch Changes

- Give the viewer Zoom and Fit controls 44-pixel touch targets through the shared workspace stylesheet.
- 0e90fbf: Add a Zoom control to the viewer toolbar. With Zoom ticked the mouse wheel zooms 2D views and right-drag pans them; untick it to scroll slices again at the same zoom, and use Fit to restore the full view.

### Patch Changes

- Updated dependencies
  - @neurodesk/webapp-components@0.6.1

### Minor Changes

- Expose typed operations across the application catalog, including multiple inputs, DICOM series selection, variable artifacts and viewer workflows. Share awaited processing and cancellation between each app and its agent adapter. Publish verified result reports and scientific provenance.

  Add bounded desktop viewer sessions and MCP controls using public viewer APIs. Native SynthSeg now reports per-label counts and physical volumes. Include real-model CPU checks and a Mac runner for Metal, WebGPU and buffer-planning evidence without raising the validated SynthSeg limit.

### Patch Changes

- 93381e8: Remove the static bottom bar (version, privacy sentence, duplicate More Apps and GitHub links) from the six inference-workspace apps. The shared app bar already shows the version and links, and Privacy has its own dialog. The unused `.app-footer` and `.nd-app-footer` rules leave the shared stylesheets and the hosted theme.
- 93381e8: Every app now opens on its workspace and shows live status only in the bottom bar: a short message, a progress bar, elapsed time and a cancel × that appears while a run can be cancelled. Start pages, landing overlays and welcome modals are gone, and their copy moved to About. Every app has a technical log below the viewer that starts collapsed. Sidebar help longer than 90 characters moved into info tooltips or About, and each sidebar has one primary action. `ProgressManager` now drives the design-system footer, including the elapsed counter and the cancel button.

  The shared example selector shows one short line once an example loads; the description and expected result moved to a tooltip beside the Example label. NiiMath gained the shared layout tabs and About dialog and no longer ships app CSS.

## 0.4.20260923

### Patch Changes

- 3e6b9a7: Add a Support action to the shared application bar, so every webapp offers one
  route to the maintainers. It opens a GitHub issue on the monorepo that is
  already filled in: the app and its build, the browser, the window size, whether
  WebGPU and cross-origin isolation are available, and headings that ask for
  reproduction steps or, for a feature suggestion, what the app should do instead.
  The prefilled page address keeps only origin and path, because app state in a
  query or fragment can name a user's own files.

  - @neurodesk/webapp-components@0.3.1
  - @neurodesk/webapp-components@0.4.1

## 0.1.20260910

### Changes

- Adopt MAJOR.MINOR.YYYYMMDD versioning, link every app to the lightNIIng ecosystem (lightniing.org) from the app bar and About dialog, and keep build scratch files off the shared /tmp volume.

## 0.1.9

### Patch Changes

- Apply the shared design system and the registry-driven About and Cite dialogs. Every app now states that it is developed and hosted by the Neurodesk team, lists the packages under the hood, names the lightning.org ecosystem, and cites one paper per implemented method plus the Neurodesk platform paper. SynthSR, SYNcro, Deface, BrowserQC and NiiMath use the shared workspace vocabulary (compact sections, one scan picker, shared toolbar, status bar and dialogs).
