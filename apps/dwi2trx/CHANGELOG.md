# dwi2trx

## 0.5.20261009

### Minor Changes

- 18697e2: Add the `dwi2trx` command line for the tensor fit: `dwi2trx DWI BVAL BVEC OUTPUT_DIR [--mask FILE | --no-mask]` runs the web app's MindGrab brain mask (on the CPU) and `niimath --dtifit` with the same vendored WebAssembly build, and writes all eleven dtifit maps under the web app's download names. Tractography is not included, because it needs WebGPU with subgroups. The fit now lives in `@neurodesk/dwi2trx`, which the web app imports. The app moves to MindGrab 0.1.20260925. Its `fit` and `tractography` automation operations accept an optional brain `mask` input and return every dtifit map. Portable archives for Linux x64 and Windows x64 and a signed macOS installer run offline. Their release check fits the pinned example and requires every map to match the web app's own download voxel for voxel.

### Patch Changes

- Updated dependencies
  - @neurodesk/webapp-components@0.6.1

### Minor Changes

- Expose typed operations across the application catalog, including multiple inputs, DICOM series selection, variable artifacts and viewer workflows. Share awaited processing and cancellation between each app and its agent adapter. Publish verified result reports and scientific provenance.

  Add bounded desktop viewer sessions and MCP controls using public viewer APIs. Native SynthSeg now reports per-label counts and physical volumes. Include real-model CPU checks and a Mac runner for Metal, WebGPU and buffer-planning evidence without raising the validated SynthSeg limit.

### Patch Changes

- 93381e8: Every app now opens on its workspace and shows live status only in the bottom bar: a short message, a progress bar, elapsed time and a cancel × that appears while a run can be cancelled. Start pages, landing overlays and welcome modals are gone, and their copy moved to About. Every app has a technical log below the viewer that starts collapsed. Sidebar help longer than 90 characters moved into info tooltips or About, and each sidebar has one primary action. `ProgressManager` now drives the design-system footer, including the elapsed counter and the cancel button.

  The shared example selector shows one short line once an example loads; the description and expected result moved to a tooltip beside the Example label. NiiMath gained the shared layout tabs and About dialog and no longer ships app CSS.

## 0.3.20260923

### Patch Changes

- 3e6b9a7: Add a Support action to the shared application bar, so every webapp offers one
  route to the maintainers. It opens a GitHub issue on the monorepo that is
  already filled in: the app and its build, the browser, the window size, whether
  WebGPU and cross-origin isolation are available, and headings that ask for
  reproduction steps or, for a feature suggestion, what the app should do instead.
  The prefilled page address keeps only origin and path, because app state in a
  query or fragment can name a user's own files.
