## 0.2.20260910

## 0.1.20260910

### Changes

- Adopt MAJOR.MINOR.YYYYMMDD versioning, link every app to the lightNIIng ecosystem (lightniing.org) from the app bar and About dialog, and keep build scratch files off the shared /tmp volume.

## 0.1.9

### Patch Changes

- Apply the shared design system and the registry-driven About and Cite dialogs. Every app now states that it is developed and hosted by the Neurodesk team, lists the packages under the hood, names the lightning.org ecosystem, and cites one paper per implemented method plus the Neurodesk platform paper. SynthSR, SYNcro, Deface, BrowserQC and NiiMath use the shared workspace vocabulary (compact sections, one scan picker, shared toolbar, status bar and dialogs).
