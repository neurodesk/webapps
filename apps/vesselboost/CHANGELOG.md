## 0.4.20260924

### Patch Changes

- Updated dependencies [39a9ea5]
  - @neurodesk/webapp-components@0.4.5

## 0.4.20260923

### Patch Changes

- 3e6b9a7: Add a Support action to the shared application bar, so every webapp offers one
  route to the maintainers. It opens a GitHub issue on the monorepo that is
  already filled in: the app and its build, the browser, the window size, whether
  WebGPU and cross-origin isolation are available, and headings that ask for
  reproduction steps or, for a feature suggestion, what the app should do instead.
  The prefilled page address keeps only origin and path, because app state in a
  query or fragment can name a user's own files.

## 0.4.20260920

### Patch Changes

- Updated dependencies [4959500]
  - @neurodesk/webapp-components@0.4.4

### Patch Changes

- Updated dependencies
  - @neurodesk/webapp-components@0.4.3

### Patch Changes

- efd8af3: Show the Example control before the file picker in every app, replace the registration apps' stale "Loading the default images" empty state, give FireANTs a CPU time budget and progress messages, ship BrowserQC's CPU MindGrab bundle with a longer segmentation budget, select CPU processing in SynthSR and brain extraction when no WebGPU adapter exists, start MuscleMap at 50 % overlap without WebGPU, and run VesselBoost's hosted example workflow in its browser tests.
- Updated dependencies
  - @neurodesk/webapp-components@0.4.2

## 0.4.20260918

### Minor Changes

- Fix the model-loading stall on the hosted site by keeping ONNX Runtime and its thread workers inside VesselBoost's isolation service-worker scope. Test the production example workflow without server-provided isolation headers so browser checks exercise the same isolation mechanism as GitHub Pages. Use a new minor version to preserve today's existing immutable release.

## 0.3.20260918

### Patch Changes

- Replace the vessel-only example with an original 3T TOF-MRA control scan from the Lausanne OpenNeuro dataset. Pin the unmodified scan and checksum in the offline inventory, retain acquisition provenance, and add a hosted-data check that rejects sparse vessel-only inputs. Verify example selection through segmentation and NIfTI download in the production browser workflow. Allow the interface audit to wait for full-resolution example imports.
- Updated dependencies
  - @neurodesk/webapp-components@0.4.1

### Patch Changes

- Replace shared UI builders with light-DOM custom elements for consoles, file fields, result lists, viewer toolbars and example selectors. Migrate app callers, isolate control IDs and upload scopes, and preserve state while cleaning up listeners and cancelled downloads across component removal.
- Updated dependencies

  - @neurodesk/webapp-components@0.4.0

- Updated dependencies
  - @neurodesk/webapp-components@0.3.1

## 0.3.20260916

### Patch Changes

- Standardize example selection across the app catalog with complete scientific input bundles, shared cancellation and retry, and explicit processing. Add missing examples, curate existing datasets, fix QSMbly retry and TopoFit cancellation, and require example manifests and browser coverage for every app and the generator.
- Updated dependencies
  - @neurodesk/webapp-components@0.3.0

## 0.3.20260915

### Patch Changes

- Updated dependencies
  - @neurodesk/webapp-components@0.2.2

### Patch Changes

- Updated dependencies
  - @neurodesk/webapp-components@0.2.1

### Minor Changes

- Add a shared Standalone action and offline desktop packaging with included, checksum-verified models and runtime dependencies. Remove the lightNIIng topbar link while retaining its About statement.

### Patch Changes

- Updated dependencies
  - @neurodesk/webapp-components@0.2.0

## 0.2.20260914

### Patch Changes

- Updated dependencies [3cd773f]
- Updated dependencies [4add8da]
  - @neurodesk/webapp-components@0.1.5

### Patch Changes

- Updated dependencies
  - @neurodesk/webapp-components@0.1.4

## 0.2.20260910

### Minor Changes

- Release the complete application catalog after integrating BrowserQC, dwi2trx and SynthSeg. Preserve shared interface behavior and publish bundles with synchronized date versions.

## 0.1.20260910

### Changes

- Adopt MAJOR.MINOR.YYYYMMDD versioning, link every app to the lightNIIng ecosystem (lightniing.org) from the app bar and About dialog, and keep build scratch files off the shared /tmp volume.

## 0.1.9

### Patch Changes

- Apply the shared design system and the registry-driven About and Cite dialogs. Every app now states that it is developed and hosted by the Neurodesk team, lists the packages under the hood, names the lightning.org ecosystem, and cites one paper per implemented method plus the Neurodesk platform paper. SynthSR, SYNcro, Deface, BrowserQC and NiiMath use the shared workspace vocabulary (compact sections, one scan picker, shared toolbar, status bar and dialogs).
- Updated dependencies
  - @neurodesk/webapp-components@0.1.3

## 0.1.8

### Patch Changes

- cd790d5: Finish shared imaging convergence by centralizing worker sessions, input handling, app-specific controllers, workspace styles, and runtime clients. Strengthen shell contracts and regression coverage.

## 0.1.7

### Patch Changes

- 5560336: Consolidate imaging workers, pipeline execution, viewer behavior, NIfTI serialization, runtime wrappers, shared styling, and hosted shell controls. Fix CALMaR analysis startup and layout, and remove horizontal overflow from Deface controls.

## 0.1.6

### Patch Changes

- 90762b0: Fix ONNX Runtime WASM URLs in composite-site builds so inference loads the shared runtime without duplicating the `/_runtime/` path.

## 0.1.5

### Patch Changes

- 46be48e: Add a persistent light and dark theme switch to the webapp catalog and every hosted or standalone webapp bundle.

## 0.1.4

### Patch Changes

- Standardize the Neurodesk app shell and add DNT/GPC-respecting page-view analytics with aggregate per-app usage statistics.

## 0.1.3

### Patch Changes

- Align the application interfaces with the Neurodesk design system and point app source links at the webapps monorepo.

## 0.1.2

### Patch Changes

- 4a4dd72: Apply the Neurodesk designer-guide theme to hosted and standalone webapp bundles.
