# TopoFit web app

TopoFit reconstructs left and right white, pial, and spherical-registration surfaces from a T1-weighted brain MRI. Processing stays in a browser worker. The app downloads hash-verified, revision-pinned BrainNet 0.2 models in ONNX format from the Neurodesk Hugging Face dataset.

Use a desktop browser with cross-origin isolation and several gigabytes of available memory. The complete order-6 reconstruction contains 245,762 vertices and 491,520 faces per hemisphere. It is research software, not motion-cleared and not for prescription.

The built-in conformer accepts axis-aligned NIfTI geometry. Conform oblique scans to a 1 mm RAS grid before loading them.

```bash
pnpm --filter topofit dev
pnpm --filter topofit build
pnpm --filter topofit test
pnpm --filter topofit test:e2e
```

For offline model development, set `TOPOFIT_ASSET_DIR` to the exported release directory and `VITE_TOPOFIT_ASSET_BASE=/model-assets/`. See [`packages/topofit/validation/README.md`](../../packages/topofit/validation/README.md) for the pinned-container comparison.

The browser exports six FreeSurfer triangular surface files, a source-grid QC NIfTI, and a JSON processing manifest. DICOM import uses the shared dcm2niix worker. Images and results are not uploaded to a processing service.
