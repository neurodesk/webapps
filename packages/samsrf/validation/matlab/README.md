# Real MATLAB source references

This recorder runs the web port's pinned SamSrf source in MATLAB R2023b. It
uses MATLAB's own optimizers, correlation, single arithmetic and geometry.
The existing [compiled container reference](../container/README.md) remains
an independent baseline for the unmodified Neurodesk application.

The source recorder is under development. Recording successfully is not a
parity assertion; its results must be compared with the web core before a
compatibility mode or new tolerance is accepted.

`prepare.py` requires the clean commit in `source.json` and applies three
explicit repairs: make the documented double-precision setting work, omit
the undefined CF surround row outside hull mode, and give `fminsearch`
double starting parameters in CF Gaussian mode. It records both file hashes
for each repair. No equation, residual shape, CSS exponent, triangulator or
optimizer is replaced. References from this repaired source must be labeled
separately from stock container results.

The manual `samsrf-native` workflow can record these cases with
`record_matlab=true`. Public GitHub Actions runs are licensed by MathWorks
for MATLAB and the required toolboxes. A MATLAB Compiler license is needed
only to package a new standalone Runtime application; it is not needed for
this source-level comparison.

On a machine with MATLAB and the required toolboxes:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/samsrf/samsrf.git "$TMPDIR/samsrf-source"
git -C "$TMPDIR/samsrf-source" checkout 41ed1e96cc4d9b8b750f5594a61845df21ab8984
python3 packages/samsrf/validation/container/download.py "$TMPDIR/samsrf-input"
python3 packages/samsrf/validation/matlab/prepare.py "$TMPDIR/samsrf-source" "$TMPDIR/samsrf-matlab"
```

Then call `record_reference(SOURCE, INPUT, OUTPUT, MATRIX_INPUT, SPM)` with
absolute paths from MATLAB after adding this directory to its path. Each array is saved as
little-endian float64 with its original class, dimensions and separate
imaginary part recorded in JSON. This preserves nonfinite values and complex
CSS results without JSON coercing them to null.

`inputs.json` pins additional raw-data subsets from the public X001 dataset
(left and right hemispheres) and the analyzePRF example participant. Download
it with `python3 packages/samsrf/validation/container/download.py MATRIX_INPUT packages/samsrf/validation/matlab/inputs.json`. Its manifest
records the original vertex indices, input hashes, timing and stimulus scale.
The second dataset's four different stimulus sequences are concatenated for
fitting; averaging is tested only as a preprocessing operation. Synthetic
anatomy is clearly marked and used only to satisfy Benson's importer, not as
evidence about cortical geometry. SPM's actual GIfTI readers are pinned in
`source.json`; there are no replacement IO functions.

The expanded recorder captures raw preprocessing, noise ceilings, coarse and
fine maps, threshold selection, reverse correlation, Benson conversion, mesh
distances and smoothed CFs in both precisions. CSS cases retain the original
apertures and separately test a nonnegative control. Saved complex MAT values
are recorded before `samsrf_expand_srf` discards their imaginary components
for export. Polygon cases cover retraced edges, duplicates, self-intersections
and thin triangles across scales. Recording any of these is still not a
passing equivalence gate until its numerical comparison is implemented.

The pinned source's reverse-correlation path cannot finish when `Rdim` differs
from the aperture width: `samsrf_revcor_prf` line 368 reshapes the full coordinate
grid to the requested profile dimensions. The source recording therefore uses
the original 100-pixel resolution. The failed 20-pixel run is evidence of an
upstream execution limit, not a passing web-equivalence case. Each completed
pipeline case also writes its own metadata so a later failure does not hide it.
