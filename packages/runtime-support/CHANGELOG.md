# @neurodesk/runtime-support

## 0.1.4

### Patch Changes

- Updated dependencies [70f2770]
  - @neurodesk/webapp-components@0.10.2

## 0.1.3

### Patch Changes

- 257192b: Stream SynthSR and SynthStrip CPU inference by operator to avoid oversized browser allocations while preserving the pinned models. Reject normalization with less than one percent positive brain support in the MNI template before exposing downloads. Add numerical parity, allocation, failure recovery, and cropped-head regressions.

## 0.1.2

### Patch Changes

- 3cd773f: Greedy and EdgeReg show all three viewer panels on phones. TopoFit conforms axis-aligned and oblique scans through the pinned npm niimath WebAssembly worker. SYNcro now matches the native three-input workflow, offers four checksum-pinned tutorials, defaults to MindGrab and Greedy with SynthStrip and ANTs alternatives, uses niimath for lesion and masking operations, and switches one NiiVue viewer between images with automatic lesion overlays. SynthSR lets adapter limits govern its largest activation buffer, so validated 256×256×192 scans and larger volumes on capable GPUs are attempted while other shared U-Net callers retain their existing limit. Add the standalone ANTS registration demo.

## 0.1.1

### Patch Changes

- 3fe15c3: Add SynthSeg brain segmentation in the browser and native executable. Pin model assets, preserve oblique NIfTI geometry, and protect cancelled processing from stale results. Share GPU inference and the standard imaging workspace.
