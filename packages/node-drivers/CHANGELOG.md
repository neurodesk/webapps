# @neurodesk/node-drivers

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- Move caller-pinned MindGrab and niimath Node drivers and their independent browser parity validation to dependency-free `@neurodesk/node-drivers`. Migrate every command line and remove the old runtime-support exports. Keep SynthSR and SynthStrip browser runtimes out of production Node deployments so portable brain-extraction and BrowserQC archives omit browser dependencies.
