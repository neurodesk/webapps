# Catalogue sites

The apps are served from several hosts. Each host serves one catalogue. Each app
has one home catalogue and can also be served by others.

| Host | Catalogue | Hosting | Apps |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `webapps.neurodesk.org` | `neuro` | GitHub Pages | every app not listed below |
| `mskapps.sciget.org` | `msk` | Cloudflare Worker, assets only | MuscleMap, SeedSeg, Carotid Flow |
| `microscopyapps.sciget.org` | `microscopy` | Cloudflare Worker, assets only | StarDist, Calcium imaging, Spot detection, Microscope QC, Deconvolution, NeuroMorph, Structure Tensor, ZARRo; elastix (also on neuro) |
| `webapps.sciget.org` | hub | Cloudflare Worker, assets only | none: one card per catalogue |

`neurodesk.org` DNS is on AWS Route 53, so the neuro catalogue stays on GitHub
Pages. `sciget.org` DNS is on Cloudflare.

## Registry

`registry/apps.yml` holds the hosts:

- `site.catalogs`: one entry per catalogue, with its `id`, `host`, `hosting`
  (`pages` or `worker`), `title`, `heading`, `description` and `brand` (product
  name, logo file in `site/`, home URL and the More Apps label).
- `site.hub`: the hub page's host, text and brand.
- `catalog:` on every app: its home catalogue. Its old links redirect there, and
  other hosts' 404 pages send its path there.
- `also_in:` on an app, optional: other catalogues that serve a copy. Each copy
  carries the brand, title and URL of the host that serves it, and appears in that
  host's landing page and DICOM View menu. Analytics counts every copy.
- `former_paths:` on an app: paths it was served from before a rename.

`scripts/lib/apps-registry.mjs` rejects an unknown, missing or repeated
`catalog`, a duplicate catalogue id or host, a catalogue without apps, and any
setup other than exactly one `pages` catalogue on `site.domain`. `also_in` must name other
declared catalogues, each once. To move an app, change its `catalog:`; to serve
it on another host too, add that catalogue to `also_in`.

## Build

`pnpm build` builds each app once, then `scripts/build-site.mjs` writes:

- `dist/`: every app, as before. The desktop suite assembles from it
  (`scripts/desktop/assemble.mjs`), so its DICOM View still hands off to every app.
- `dist-sites/<catalogue>/`: one deployable site per catalogue
  (`scripts/lib/catalog-sites.mjs`).
- `dist-sites/hub/`: the hub page (`scripts/lib/hub-page.mjs`).
- `dist-sites/<site>.wrangler.json`: the Worker configuration of each
  Worker-hosted site, generated from the registry.

A catalogue site holds:

- its apps, themed again with the catalogue's brand and a handoff list of the
  apps on that host;
- the shared root files the app pages load (`app-shell.js`, `theme.js`, fonts,
  logos, `shell-adapters/`);
- the `_runtime/` families its files reference. A family is the directory two
  levels below `_runtime/` and is copied whole. References are followed between
  families. A `_runtime/` mention that is not a plain string path fails the build;
- its landing page, `standalone.json` entries, `_headers` and `404.html`.

`test/catalog-sites.test.mjs` checks the built sites. Each site holds exactly its
catalogue's apps and exactly the runtime families its files reach. Every
reference that resolves in `dist/` also resolves in the site. Every handoff menu
lists only same-host apps. `pnpm audit:artifacts` audits `dist/` and each site,
and applies the 750 MiB Pages budget to the `pages` site only.

## Moved apps

`site/404.html` is a template. `scripts/lib/not-found-page.mjs` renders it per
host with a table from the registry:

- a former path redirects to its app;
- an app of another catalogue redirects to that catalogue's host.

The redirect keeps the rest of the path, the query and the fragment, so
`https://webapps.neurodesk.org/musclemap/?x=1#y` reaches
`https://mskapps.sciget.org/musclemap/?x=1#y`. GitHub Pages and the Worker
(`not_found_handling: 404-page`) both serve `404.html` for a missing path. A
returning visitor's isolation service worker fetches navigations from the
network (`coi-serviceworker.js`), so the 404 page runs. dicompare's route bridge
loads only on the host that serves dicompare.

The legacy domains `musclemap.neurodesk.org` and `seedseg.neurodesk.org` redirect
to `https://webapps.neurodesk.org/<app>/` (checked 2026-11-05). That page is
missing on the neuro host, so the 404 table sends the visitor on to
`mskapps.sciget.org`. The redirect repositories do not need a change.

## Accepted regression

A handoff opens the receiving app on the same origin. DICOM View on
`webapps.neurodesk.org` therefore no longer offers MuscleMap, SeedSeg or Carotid
Flow. These apps still take DICOM and NIfTI files directly. The desktop suite
keeps every handoff.

## Deployment

`.github/workflows/deploy-pages.yml` builds once, then:

- uploads `dist-sites/neuro` to GitHub Pages;
- deploys `dist-sites/msk`, `dist-sites/microscopy` and `dist-sites/hub` with
  `wrangler deploy --config dist-sites/<site>.wrangler.json`, using the
  `CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN` and `CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID` secrets;
- runs the deployed checks (`pnpm test:deployed`,
  `test/standalone-downloads.smoke.mjs`, `pnpm test:image-uploads`) once per host,
  with `SITE_CATALOG=<catalogue>` limiting them to that host's apps.

The Cloudflare API token needs Workers Scripts edit on the account, plus
Workers Routes and DNS edit on the `sciget.org` zone. Wrangler needs these to
attach the custom domains.

## Adding a catalogue

1. Add an entry to `site.catalogs` with `hosting: worker`, and add its logo to
   `site/` if it has a new brand.
2. Set `catalog:` on its apps.
3. Add its host to the `deploy-workers` and `verify-workers` matrices in `deploy-pages.yml`. The Pages deploy waits for `deploy-workers`, so the neuro 404 page never redirects to a host that is not live yet.
4. Build, then run `node --test test/catalog-sites.test.mjs` and
   `pnpm audit:artifacts`.
